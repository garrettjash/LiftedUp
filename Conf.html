                            <h2 class="fw-bolder">The Eternal Principle of Love</h2>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Jesus walked with no fear and with no doubt to Gethsemane, trusting in His Father, knowing that He must tread the winepress alone. He endured all pain and all humiliation. He was accused, judged, and crucified. During His own agony and suffering on the cross, Jesus focused on the needs of His mother and His beloved disciple. He offered His life.
                                (Elder Hugo Montoya, ¶ 34)

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder">Be Perfected in Him</h2>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">The Savior taught that we “should be perfect.” This can seem so daunting. I can clearly see my personal inadequacies and am painfully aware of the distance between me and perfection. We may have a tendency to think we have to perfect ourselves, but that is not possible. Following every suggestion in every self-help book in the world will not bring it about. There is only one way and one name whereby perfection comes. We are “made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.” Our perfection is only possible through God’s grace.
                                (Elder Paul V. Johnson, ¶ 11)

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder">The Doctrine of Belonging</h2>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Thus, the doctrine of belonging comes down to this—each one of us can affirm: Jesus Christ died for me; He thought me worthy of His blood. He loves me and can make all the difference in my life. As I repent, His grace will transform me. I am one with Him in the gospel covenant; I belong in His Church and kingdom; and I belong in His cause to bring redemption to all of God's children.
                                (Elder D. Todd Christofferson, ¶ 44)

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder">Lifted Up upon the Cross</h2>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Another reason for not using iconized crosses is our emphasis on the complete miracle of Christ's mission—His glorious Resurrection as well as His sacrificial suffering and death. In underscoring that relationship, I note two pieces of art that serve as backdrops for the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in their sacred weekly temple meetings each Thursday in Salt Lake City. These portrayals serve as constant reminders to us of the price that was paid and the victory that was won by Him whose servants we are. (¶ 9) <br><br>
                                A more public representation of Christ's two-part triumph is our use of this small Thorvaldsen image of the resurrected Christ emerging in glory from the tomb with the wounds of His Crucifixion still evident. (¶ 10) <br><br>
                                As we take up our crosses and follow Him, it would be tragic indeed if the weight of our challenges did not make us more empathetic for and more attentive to the burdens being carried by others. It is one of the most powerful paradoxes of the Crucifixion that the arms of the Savior were stretched wide open and then nailed there, unwittingly but accurately portraying that every man, woman, and child in the entire human family is not only welcome but invited into His redeeming, exalting embrace. (¶ 15)<br><br>
                                As the glorious Resurrection followed the agonizing Crucifixion, so blessings of every kind are poured out on those who are willing, as the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob says, to “believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross. (Jeffrey R. Holland, ¶ 16)

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder">Overcome the World and Find Rest</h2>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Before the Savior submitted Himself to the agony of Gethsemane and Calvary, He declared to His Apostles, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” Subsequently, Jesus entreated each of us to do the same when He said, “I will that ye should overcome the world.”
                                (Russell M. Nelson, ¶ 13)
                                </p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder">That They Might Know Thee</h2>
                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Knowing that His Crucifixion was just hours away, Jesus said: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” Today, as our world is frequently polarized and divided, there is a great need for us to preach and practice positivity, optimism, and hope. Despite any challenges in our past, faith always points toward the future, filled with hope, allowing us to fulfill Jesus’s invitation to be of good cheer. Joyfully living the gospel helps us to become disciples of good things to come.
                                (Jonathan S. Schmitt, ¶ 12)

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">We are blessed to have countless examples of ancient and modern-day prophets who have boldly borne their testimonies.<br>
                                Following Christ's death, Peter stood and testified:<br>
                                “Be it known unto you all … that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, … doth this man stand here before you.<br>
                                “… For there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
                                (Gary E. Stevenson, ¶ 56-59)
